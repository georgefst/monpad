/*
TODO This may be our worst hack yet...

The issue is that `elm-collage` doesn't let us add styles to an SVG `foreignObject` directly.
It would presumably be a straightforward thing to add, but that library is currently unmaintained.

This works for now because the only `foreignObject`s we have are for images and text, which are precisely where we do
want pointer events disabled.

Another reason this is horrible is that `elm reactor` becomes basically unusable, since we need this CSS file for
correct behaviour.

foreignObject {
    pointer-events: none;
